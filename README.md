# Nitrogen-by-CO2-by-inoculation growth chamber experiment

This repository contains data and analyses reported in Perkowski et al. (2023). The manuscript investigates the effects of nitrogen availability on leaf and whole-plant responses to elevated CO2 in Glycine max L. (Merr) seedlings with and without inoculation by Bradyrhizobium japonicum. Folder contents are as follows:

 - `data` contains a cleaned and compiled data file (`data/NxCO2xI_data.csv`) used for all analyses. A metadata file (`data/NxCO2xI_metadata.csv`) is also included.
 - `analyses` contains R scripts used for data analysis (`analyses/NxCO2xI_analyses.R`), plots (`analyses/NxCO2xI_plots.R`), and chamber climate assessments (`analyses/NxCO2xI_assess_chamber_climate.R`)
 - `chamber_climate` contains all chamber climate data from both chamber readouts (`chamber_climate/machine_readout/`) and HOBO temperature loggers (`chamber_climate/hobo`)

Please contact Evan Perkowski (evan.a.perkowski@ttu.edu) over any data usage or queries regarding these data.
